# Hack The Change 2022 YYC
### Inspiration
Chosen prompt: 'How do we promote healthy and sustainable living for general populations?

### What it does
Keeps track of perishable user purchases and seperates the input into 3 different fields (Purchased, Expiring Soon and Expired)
Simple UI for now to have a fast and easy to read list view for each category

Reason for doing so is to reduce unneccessary food waste to make it easy to be sustainable

### Possible future implementations:
Automatic entry through image recognition of product
Image to text conversion for automatic expiration entry


### Technologies used
- PyQt (UI library)
- Python

### Features
-Add/remove purchases
-compare expiration date vs actual date to sort into lists
-keep inputs in txt file so that is retrievable
-changes are updates in realtime in the textfile as well as the GUI
